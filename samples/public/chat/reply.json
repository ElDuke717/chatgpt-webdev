It's also about problem solving, creativity, and a lot of persistence. Here are some things that could help you:\n\n1. Self-learning: The internet is full of resources, tutorials, and courses that can help you learn web development from the basics to the advanced topics.\n\n2. Practice: You need to be persistent and patient. Constant practice will help you solidify your skills.\n\n3. Build a portfolio: Start with simple projects, then gradually take on more complex ones. This way, you can learn and also demonstrate your skills to potential employers.\n\n4. Learn from others: Join a community of web developers where you can ask questions, share experiences, and learn from more accomplished web developers.\n\n5. Stay Updated: Web development is a field that changes rapidly. Keep up-to-date with the latest tools and technologies.\n\nRemember, everyone starts from somewhere, so it's normal to feel like you don't know much in the beginning. As long as you're willing to put in the time and effort, you have a good chance of being successful. Good luck!"
